# TODO

- The code doesn't take into account that the numbers could be bigger than 9! (FIXED)
- Make a function of the comparing code (DONE)
- How to copy each pair of packets into each array?
  - First how to open a txt file (OK)
  - Count the number of chars until "\n" and create an array of that size (OK)
- Make a function out of taking from the txt file so it goes through all the pairs (OK)
- Check cases when one side runs out of items
- Keep track of the pair index (OK)
- Sum the indices of the pairs that were on the right order (OK)

The result is wrong for my input data, but right for the test data: That means that I am not comparing properly some case that does not happen in the example
